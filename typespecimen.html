        <h1>Type Specimen</h1>
        <div class="ProjectPageIntro">
            <p class="BodyLarge">I designed a type specimen for the typeface IBM Plex Serif for a project in my typographic design class. After researching the typeface and writing the content, I designed a 16-page spread to show its uses. I went through multiple rounds of critique and revisions that helped me create a design that shows how IBM Plex Serif visually evokes IBM's message of uniting “mankind and machine.” Since the type specimen is intended to show off and promote the typeface, I paid special attention to my type handling to promote maximum readability while also creating an interesting and clear layout and visual hierarchy.</p>

        <h2>The Situation</h2>
        <p>I designed a 16-page typographic specimen that showcased the unique features, uses, and  background of a typeface. Since the project was for my typographic design class, one of the constraints I had to follow was that I was not allowed to use images in my design. I had to use type handling, layout, and color to create a unique design that showcased the versatility and unique features of IBM Plex Serif.</p>
        <h2>Why IBM Plex Serif?</h2>
        <p>Over the summer, I learned about IBM's new corporate typeface superfamily, IBM Plex, as a participant in the design track of the IBM Accelerate Program. Months later, after receiving this assignment, I decided that I wanted to learn more about IBM Plex because it had a very distinct and interesting design. I chose the serif variation (IBM Plex Serif) because it was intriguing how it had influences from older typographic styles yet still reflected IBM as a modern technology company.
        </p>
        <h2>Research and Content</h2>
        <p>Before starting on the design, I had to do background research on IBM Plex Serif in order to write the content contained in my type specimen. This proved to be a little challenging since the typeface is fairly new, so there wasn't a ton of information on it compared to older typefaces. After researching IBM Plex Serif, I wrote all the content that my type specimen would have, such as the history of the typeface.</p>
        <h2>The Design Process</h2>
        <h3>“It's boring”</h3>
        <p>After designing my first draft, my professor commented that the design reflected IBM because it was pretty boring. While I disagreed with her assessment of IBM being a boring company (the IBM Accelerate Program showed me otherwise), I agreed that my first draft was pretty boring. The critique from my professor and my classmates helped me in designing my future drafts to better reflect how interesting IBM and its typeface actually are.</p>
        <h3>Honing in on a Final Design</h3>
        <p>With each round of critique and revision, my design was becoming more visually interesting. One thing that also helped me improve my design was to focus on a key message. IBM describes the IBM Plex family as reflecting the company's mission of connecting “mankind and machine.” I noticed specific features of the typeface that reflected that value, so I leaned into that with my design.</p>
        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Some visual elements and motifs I repeated throughout my design, such as the blue lines (representative of the bars in IBM's Logo). These lines helped to bring cohesiveness to the design of my type specimen, while also serving specific purposes in their individual usage.</li>
            <li>I used large punctuation marks as dominant elements on some pages to create visual interest and draw the eye into specific parts of the layout. This also helped to showcase IBM Plex Serif's unique punctuation marks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>My professor commented on the progression of this design, saying:<br><span class="Quote">"What I appreciate about this design is your concept. You had it from the very beginning and when it didn't quite work at the beginning, instead of trying something else, you worked on it to make it work"</span>
