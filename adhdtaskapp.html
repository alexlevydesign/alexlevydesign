                                   People with ADHD often have a difficult time starting and completing tasks. To understand the reasons for this, I talked to someone with ADHD and did secondary research in order to get a wide range of viewpoints to better understand the challenges that people with ADHD have creating and completing tasks.<br><br>
                                   I then designed an app that helps people create and complete tasks by taking them through a simple and quick process that encourages them to think more deeply about why they are creating the task.

        <p>People with ADHD often have trouble starting and staying focused on tasks that they need to complete. Many people try to use physical or digital planners, reminders, calendars, and agendas, but they each come with their own set of problems.</p>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <div class="FindingsGrid">
            <h3>Secondary research</h3>
            <p>I started my design process by doing qualitative secondary research about ADHD and how people with ADHD use apps to stay on track. I did most of my secondary research on a Reddit community for people with ADHD.</p>
            <ul class="FindingsGrid">
                <li>Many people with ADHD find it <b class="Bolded">helpful to make lists and schedules to keep track of tasks</b> since it is easy to get overwhelmed or not follow through with tasks.</li>
                <li>An important aspect of managing ADHD is <b class="Bolded">splitting large tasks up into smaller subtasks</b> to make them more manageable.</li>
                <li>One article said that it is <b class="Bolded">important for people with ADHD to think about why the task that they want to complete is important to them.</b></li>

        <h3>User interview</h3>
        <p>To learn more about the problems people with ADHD have with task planning, I talked to someone with ADHD.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                While she often procrastinates, she never does so on tasks she considers very important.
            </li>
            <li>When she uses digital methods of managing her ADHD (such as a calendar app), she expects it to be easy to use.</li>
            <li>She doesn't want to use an app that takes time to learn how to use.</li>
        </ul>

 <h3>Brainstorming</h3>

        <h2>The design process</h2>
        <h3>Early wireframes</h3>
        <div class="OptimalAssessmentWireframe">
            <img src="images/TaskApp/ADHDTaskAppWireframes.png">
        </div>
        <h3>A false start</h3>
        <p>After designing a few screens, I realized that I was making a generic calendar app instead of focusing on improving the process of creating and completing tasks. After realizing this, I looked back at my research and notes to remind myself what my goal was.</p>
       
        <h3>Reorienting myself</h3>
        <p>I started by writing down the prompts that the user would be shown throughout the task creation process. Some of these were common among productivity apps, but others were not as standard.</p>
        <h3>Design decisions</h3>
        <h4>UX design/information architecture</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I split up the task creation process into three screens to encourage the user to complete the steps in order, instead of, for instance, doing the subtasks before thinking about why the task is important to them. I wanted the user to think more deeply about their motivations first.</li>
            <li>I added a task sharing feature because sharing tasks with friends can help keep the user motivated to want to complete tasks. It can also give them a feeling of accomplishment when they do complete tasks.</li>
            <li>When a user creates a task, the sharing toggle switch defaults to "no" to ensure that a user doesn't accidentally share a task that they want to keep private.</li>
            <li>I added an input field for the user to leave themself an encouraging note so they can get a boost of encouragement.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Visual design</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I used a monochromatic color scheme to limit the complexity of the design. This made the design more cohesive, while also making each screen less distracting.</li>
            <li>In addition to using proper color contrast, I also made sure not to use color as the only signifier that an element can be interacted with.</li>
            <li>For my typefaces, I chose Rubik for my headings and Open Sans for my body copy because they are both sans-serif typefaces, which are easier to read on small screens. Additionally, according to my research, people with dyslexia might find serif typefaces harder to read.</li>
        </ul>
        <!--
 <h4>Content</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I wrote the copy in a friendly, encouraging, and energetic tone to keep the user motivated throughout the process.</li>
            <li>All the copy is clear and concise to help limit potential confusion and frustration.</li>
        </ul>
        -->
       
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
                            <p> I designed an app to help people with ADHD plan and complete their tasks. In the future, I would like to do user testing to see how the design would work in a real-world context.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
                            <h3 class="heading4">Focus on the user</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>At first, I was just designing a basic task planning app, without thinking about how it could solve the user problems that I learned about in my research. Realizing this, I changed course and focused on solving those user problems.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <h3 class="heading4">Make things accessible</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>While accessibility is always important, I placed an additional focus on it for this project since the app is designed for neurodiverse people. I learned how to create an accessible color palette and how typeface choice affects accessibility.</li>
