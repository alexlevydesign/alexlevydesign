        <h2>The situation</h2>
        <p>During my IBM internship, I sat in on a workshop with a major financial institution that wanted to explore IBM's generative AI solutions. A lot of problems and ideas were shared, but one in particular stood out to me: <b class="Bolded">how could generative AI help people who have questions complex and personal financial situations?</b></p>
        <!-- <p>The but were ultimately shelved because even though that use case was ranked as most important, it was also ranked as least feasible.</p>
        <p><b class="Bolded">Even so, I recognized that this use case had potential, so after getting my manager's approval, I started to explore how IBM's AI solutions could provide user and business value by helping people with complex financial situations.</b></p> -->
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Talking to an expert</h3>
        <p>I spoke with an expert on the banking industry and the different users and stakeholders involved in financial advising. He gave me four main personas, but said that one group of people is particularly underserved in terms of financial advising:</p>
        <ul>
            <!-- <li><span class="Bolded">Young adults with first well-paying job:</span>
                This group of people has newly found disposable income, making around $60,000/year. They now need to make choices about how to use this new disposable income responsibly.
            </li> -->
            <!-- <li><span class="Bolded">New parents:</span>
                A bit older than the previous group, these individuals are married and have one or two children. They may be encountering types of financial decisions for the first time, such as how to save for a house, build credit and develop college funds.
            </li> -->
            <li><span class="Bolded">People between 40 and 50-years-old:</span> These are established professionals with high-school aged kids. They are doing well financially, but still face challenges with wealth accumulation and management. Issues such as college funds and saving for retirement are becoming more prevalent as they begin to consider their longer-term goals.</li>
            <!-- <li><span class="Bolded">People about to retire:</span> For this group of people, they are thinking about how they can retain their current lifestyle post-retirement. They might be focusing on issues such as longer-term healthcare.</li> -->
        </ul>
        
       
        <!--
 <ul>
            <li>I spoke with professors to learn about how they go about designing a course. One thing I learned is that different professors have different methods for designing their courses because of the specific requirements that they need to fulfill.</li>
            
            
        </ul>
        -->
       
        <h3>Secondary research</h3>
        <p>Because this wasn't an official client project, I wasn't given any resources to help me in conducting user research, but that didn't stop me from doing research to understand the user groups and potential challenges that they face.</p>
       
        <h4>Many young adults turn to social media</h4>
        <ul><li>One article said that 47% of young adult respondents use Reddit for financial information and advice.</li>
        <li>This stood out to me because users looking for personal financial advice might appreciate the ability to stay anonymous while fostering personal connections.</li></ul>
        <h4>Retirement planning is overwhelming for many</h4>
        <ul><li>37% of adults surveyed said they have not done any retirement planning, and 76% of that group says that they find planning for retirement overwhelming.</li>
        <li>A trusted, accessible source of financial information could help this group start to make a plan.</li></ul>
        <h4>Financial advisor usage is low</h4>
        <ul><li>For most age groups of adults older than 40, the percentage of people who report major financial stress is lower than the percentage of people who talk about their financial problems with a financial advisor.</li></ul>

        <h2>The design process</h2>
        <h3>Thinking about the user</h3>
        <h4>Persona</h4>
        <img src="images/AI-financial-advisor/Persona.png" class="LongImage" alt="A user persona">
        <h3>Ideating</h3>
        <h4>How Might I...</h4>
        <p>Using the information I learned about the potential users and the financial advising and banking industries, I created some statements to focus on user problems.</p>
        <div class="ImageProcess">
            <img src="images/AI-financial-advisor/How-might-I.png">
        </div>
        
        
        <h3>Forming a team</h3>
        <p>When an internal, companywide hackathon was announced, I knew that this project could be taken further. First, I recruited two other designer interns to help with the interface and experience design.</p>
        <h3>Medium fidelity prototype design decisions</h3>
        <h4>Initial iteration: chatbot screen</h4>
        <div>
            <img src="images/AI-financial-advisor/Iteration-1.png" class="LongImage" alt="The first iteration of the chatbot screen.">
        </div>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Bolded">User need:</span>
                People with questions about unique financial situations often turn to social media so they can get personalized and specific answers.
            </li>
            <li><span class="Bolded">My solution:</span>
                I designed an interface for users to chat with a chatbot about their financial questions, with the ability to select specific strings of their prompt to adjust the importance they want assigned to that part of their question.
            </li>
            <li><span class="Bolded">Why I did this:</span>
                On social media sites, a person can indicate which parts of their question they deem more important than others by using factors such as the tone of their writing, formatting, and other context clues. While a chatbot can interpret some of these things to an extent, I added this feature to make it easier for the user to give the chatbot relevant information.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Initial iteration: goals screen</h4>
        <div>
            <img src="images/AI-financial-advisor/FinancialGoalsIteration1.png" class="LongImage" alt="The first iteration of the goals screen.">
        </div>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Bolded">User need:</span>
                It can be difficult to set financial goals if you don't know the how to best measure success.
            </li>
            <li><span class="Bolded">My solution:</span>
                I designed a screen where the user can view the financial goals that they create. It also displays relevant resources that the user may find useful in achieving their financial goals.
            </li>
            <li><span class="Bolded">Why I did this:</span>
                Because this application would be integrated into a user's bank, the goals could be generated based on the data from their account. Any updates to goal progress would be reflected on this page, taking much of the hassle and guesswork out of the process. The resources could also guide users to the bank's various offerings and services, creating value for both the user and the bank.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <li>I wanted to let the user input multiple items in a list that they can see on the same page. I designed a component that would let the user do this, but my first iteration was very confusing during user testing, as the professor had a hard time understanding how to interact with it. I simplified the component in my second iteration. In my third iteration, I made the visual design more on-brand.</li>

            <li>I chose to make the course setup process extend over multiple screens so the professor could think about each part both by itself and in the context of the previous screens. If the entire process was on a single page, the professor might not think of it as a sequential process.</li>
         
                <li>On the other hand, for the "Create Assessment" screen, I chose to place all the course information checkboxes and text input boxes on the same screen because it is not a sequential process.</li>

       <!-- <h3>Design decisions</h3>
       <h4>UX design/information architecture</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>Originally, the create course screen was divided across multiple separate screens. After looking at research about form patterns, I learned that splitting a form across multiple screens can create friction if a user decides to go back and change previous responses. I consolidated these screens into one, which should improve usability. However, when I conduct additional user testing I will pay close attention to validate this.</li>
       </ul>
        <h4>Visual design</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I used green to signal primary actions to the user, such as a button that takes the user to the next page. I used red components to signify that an element will change something on the page when interacted with.</li>
        </ul> -->

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>I organized a cross-functional team of designers, developers, data scientists, and sales and marketing specialists to build an AI financial advisor for an internal hackathon.</p>
        <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
        <h3 class="heading4">Think about the user and business value</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A mentor encouraged me to consider not only the user value, but also the business value.</li> 
                <li>As a result, I started to think about this project in terms of how improving the financial planning experience of a bank's account holders will ultimately help the bank build customer loyalty and promote bank services.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3 class="heading4">Work within a design system</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>By using IBM's design system, Carbon, for this project, I learned best practices for designing experiences using an existing design system. At first, I tended to detach components a lot, which is not the best practice.</li>
            <li>As the project went on, I learned the importance of using the existing components properly in order to make the development process smoother and to keep consistency in the design.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="heading4">Narrow the scope</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>While the other designers and I did our best to design an interface using best design system practices, we had to significantly narrow the scope of the final developed prototype that we submitted for the hackathon.</li>
            <li>Despite this, our design thinking process allowed us to still develop a prototype that can meet user and business needs.</li>
        </ul>
