        <h1>ADHD Task App</h1>
        <div class="ProjectPageIntro">
            <p class="BodyLarge">I designed a prototype of a task-tracking app meant for people with ADHD. I conducted secondary research about the problems people with ADHD have in general as well as with apps. After reflecting on my research, I was able to define the pain points that people with ADHD experience, from which I could ideate solutions. I decided to design an app that helps people with ADHD create and complete tasks. During the design process, I used UX design, visual design, content design, and information architecture to improve the task creation process. To create a quality user experience, I based many of my design decisions on how people with ADHD would perceive and use different parts of the design.</p>

        <h2 class="ProjectPageH2">The Situation</h2>
        <p>I designed an app to help people with ADHD be more successful in planning, starting, and completing tasks. People with ADHD often have trouble starting and staying focused on tasks that they need to complete. Many people try to use physical or digital planners, reminders, calendars, and agendas, but they each come with their own set of problems.</p>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <div class="FindingsGrid">
            <p>I started my design process by doing qualitative secondary research about ADHD and how people with ADHD use apps to stay on track. I did most of my secondary research on a Reddit community for people with ADHD.</p>
            <h3>My Findings</h3>
            <p>Many people with ADHD find it helpful (and often times necessary) to make lists and schedules to keep track of tasks. Since it is easy for someone with ADHD to forget, get overwhelmed, or not follow through with tasks, apps can be very useful in managing ADHD.</p>
            <p>People with ADHD find it easy to get distracted when trying to focus on a task.</p>
            <p>An important aspect of managing ADHD is splitting large tasks up into smaller subtasks, which can be helpful in making tasks more manageable.</p>
            <p>According to one article, it is important for people with ADHD to "consider why a particular task is important to you."</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
        <p>I put my reserach together and used it to connect the problems people with ADHD face to potential solutions.</p>

        <h2>The Design Process</h2>
        <h3>A False Start</h3>
        <p>After designing a few screens, I realized that I was making a generic calendar app instead of focusing on improving the process of creating and completing tasks. After realizing this, I looked back at my research and notes to remind myself what my goal was.</p>
        <h3>Reorienting myself</h3>
        <p>I started by writing down the prompts that the user would be shown throughout the task creation process. Some of these were obvious and shared among most productivity apps (such as the task name, duration, and subtasks). But others were not as standard (such as asking the user why they want to do this task and allowing them to type a motivational message to send to themselves at a certain time).</p>
        <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
        <h4>UX Design/Information Architecture</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I split up the task creation process into three screens to make it less overwhelming for the user while also encouraging them to think more deeply about each individual part.</li>
            <li>I chose to place the “why do you want to complete this task” prompt on the first screen because I wanted the user to think about why they want to complete the task and their motivations behind it before they move on to planning the task.</li>
            <li>I limited the complexity of the design by limiting the features, as the more features there are, the more distracting the app becomes. Originally I had ideas to include a note-taking feature and digital points for completing tasks, but decided that those features would take away from the main purpose of the app.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Visual Design</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I used a monochromatic color scheme to limit the complexity of the design. This made the design more cohesive, while also making each screen less distracting.</li>
            <li>I used the color tool on material.io and a Figma plugin to check the contrast of the elements in my design. I also made sure not to use color as the only signifier that an element can be interacted with.</li>
            <li>For my typefaces, I chose Rubik for my headings and Open Sans for my body copy because they are both sans-serif typefaces, which are easier to read on small screens. Additionally, according to my research, people with dyslexia might find serif typefaces harder to read.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Content</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I wrote the copy in a friendly, encouraging, and energetic tone. For example, the headings on on each of the task creation screens have a fun and encouraging tone to keep the user motivated throughout the process.</li>
            <li>All the copy, from the headings and subheadings to the body copy and button text, is clear and concise. This helps to limit any potential confusion and frustration.</li>
        </ul>
