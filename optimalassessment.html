            College students may struggle in courses even though they understand the material if assessments (such as essays or multiple-choice exams) don't  align with students' strengths. But professors say that implementing alternative assessment methods would be challenging.<br><br>
           I designed a course design application to help professors create courses for students with diverse learning styles and assessment preferences. My business-focused partner and I won first place in a business pitch competition with this project.

        <h2 class="ProjectPageH2">The situation</h2>
        <h3>The origin of Optimal Assessment</h3>
        <p>I partnered with two other designers at a hackathon to design a tool where students would list their preferred testing options (such as multiple-choice) for the professor to see in a dashboard. The designers I worked with were not able to continue with the project after the hackathon, but I kept going.</p>
        <h3>A band-aid solution</h3>
        <p>Did our design really solve the problem of helping professors design courses for students with diverse learning styles? I started to wonder why so many professors stick to giving the standard multiple-choice assessment when students could learn more from interactive experiences or student-led projects.<br><br><b class="Bolded">To find out why, I needed to do some user research.</b></p>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <!--
<h3>User interviews</h3>
        <h4>A philosophy professor's philosophy on teaching</h4>
        <p>A philosophy professor I had structured his course with practical projects that gave students flexibility in how they approached them. This professor told me that one challenge with his course structure is developing fair grading guidelines, as even if there is artistic skill involved in a philosophy project, he can't grade based on that artistic skill.</p>
        -->
        
        <h3>Survey results and insights</h3>
        <p>I surveyed eight professors, asking them about their course design process, the challenges that they face designing courses, and whether they would consider offering student guided creative projects.</p>

            <li>Universal Design for Learning is an educational framework that flips the course design process on its head: first you create learning goals, then you design engaging assessments, and you finish by designing lessons.</li>
            <li>This framework helped me structure the information architecture of the application to follow this format.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Putting it all together</h3>

        <p>During the course design process, professors are focused on...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Organizing course elements such as topics and notes.</li>
            <li>Planning schedules, lessons, and assessments.</li>
            <li>Creating assessments that can be graded in a fair and consistent manner.</li>
            <li>Understanding the learning styles of the class.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>A revised problem</h4>
        <p>I now had a better understanding of the true problem that professors have with designing courses to fit varying learning styles:<br><span class="Quote">Students learn in different ways, but many course structures
            are one-size-fits-all. Professors want to give students a learning experience that works for everyone, but they don't know the learning styles of the class they are designing the course for.<br><br>
            
            Radically adjusting course structure to fit every student is necessary but is currently a massive undertaking.</span></p>
        
       
        <h2>The design process</h2>
        
        <p>Before I started designing screens, I put together what I knew about the professors who would be using this course design application and made a user journey about what they would need to do to design an ideal course.</p>
        <h3>User journey</h3>
        <img src="images/optimal-assessment/ProcessGraphics/User-journey.png" class="LongImage" alt="A user journey that I made.">

        <h4>Thinking critically about course elements</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="Bolded">User need:</span>
                Professors have to consider many factors when designing a course such as class goals and topics.
            </li>
            <li><span class="Bolded">My solution:</span>
                I designed screens where the user can input these factors into lists, which would appear during the assessment creation flow to encourage the professor to think about, for instance, how the assessment they are creating achieves course goals.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Forming connections between course elements</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="Bolded">User need:</span>
                The professors I surveyed like organizing course elements in one place, but they still have problems seeing how each element fits into the course as a whole.
            </li>
            <li><span class="Bolded">My solution:</span>
                I designed a whiteboarding canvas screen where professors could connect course elements together spatially to help form relationships between ideas and elements. This could help the professors organize information and create new connections between different parts of the course.
            </li> 
            </ul>
            <h4>Creating timelines and schedules</h4>
            <ul>
               <li><span class="Bolded">User need:</span>
                Professors said that creating timelines and fitting assessments into the schedule is a challenge.
            </li>
            <li><span class="Bolded">My solution:</span>
                I added a "key dates" section where professors can split up individual assessments into smaller chunks to make timelines more manageable for themselves and students.
            </li>

            <h4>A confusing component</h4>
            <p>Because a course can have many different elements (such as a long list of topics), I needed to design a component that would allow professors to continuously add entries to a list through user input.</p>

             <h3>Design decisions</h3>
        <h4>Component UX</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I wanted to let the user input multiple items in a list that they can see on the same page. I designed a component that would let the user do this, but my first iteration was very confusing during user testing, as the professor had a hard time understanding how to interact with it. I simplified the component in my second iteration. In my third iteration, I made the visual design more on-brand.</li>

            <li class="OptimalAssessmentScreenFlowVertical"><img src="images/optimal-assessment/ProcessGraphics/ScreenOrderGraphicVertical.svg"></li>
            <li>I chose to make the course setup process extend over multiple screens so the professor could think about each part both by itself and in the context of the previous screens. If the entire process was on a single page, the professor might not think of it as a sequential process.</li>
         
                <li>On the other hand, for the "Create Assessment" screen, I chose to place all the course information checkboxes and text input boxes on the same screen because it is not a sequential process.</li>
            </ul>

       <h3>Final design decisions</h3>
       <h4>UX design/information architecture</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>Originally, the create course screen was divided across multiple separate screens. After looking at research about form patterns, I learned that splitting a form across multiple screens can create friction if a user decides to go back and change previous responses. I consolidated these screens into one, which should improve usability. However, when I conduct additional user testing, I will pay close attention to validate this.</li>
       </ul>
        <h4>Visual design</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I used green to signal primary actions to the user, such as a button that takes the user to the next page. I used red components to signify that an element will change something on the page when interacted with.</li>
            <li>In my final design, I more rigidly adhered to a grid system compared to my original medium fidelity prototype. This made the visual hierarchy  clearer and should improve usability.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>I pitched this MVP with my partner in a business pitch competition and won first place. I am currently developing it into a functional MVP for improved user testing.</span>
        <h2>Lessons learned</h2>
        <h3 class="heading4">A consistent design system</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>One thing I learned from creating my own design system for this project is that reusing elements across contexts helps with rapid iteration and creating a cohesive product.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3 class="heading4">Being the only designer is tough</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>My partner is not a designer, so I was in charge of the user research, UX design, visual design, and content design. As the only designer on this project, I had to stretch myself and my skills.</li>
            <li>
                This helped me grow as a designer, but also limited the project's potential since I didn't have another design perspective on the project. This is why I am planning to onboard another designer.
            </li>
        </ul>
